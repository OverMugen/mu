# Examples

These example programs are intended to give a quick feel for Mu syntax and features.
To run them, you need the Mu host from the source-of-truth repository at `https://git.mills.io/prologic/mu`.

If you add or update examples, please submit the change to the source-of-truth repo so it can be mirrored here.
