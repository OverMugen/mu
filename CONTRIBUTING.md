## What belongs here

This GitHub mirror is intentionally limited to:

- User-facing documentation
- A small selection of examples
- GitHub-specific community guidance

If you want to propose changes to the language, runtime, or tooling, please do so in the source-of-truth repo.

## Suggested workflow

1. Fork the repo on `https://git.mills.io/prologic/mu`.
2. Create a branch for your changes.
3. Keep changes focused and explain why they are needed.
4. Open a pull request against the default branch.

If your change is GitHub-docs specific, note that in the PR description so it can be mirrored back here.
